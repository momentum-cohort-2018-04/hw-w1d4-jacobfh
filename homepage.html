            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2>A Short Story</h2>
            <p>My name is Jacob Heivly. I am a 24 year old, aspiring software developer from 
                Chapel Hill, North Carolina. I grew up as a hyperactive child constantly wanting to try something
                new. Pretty soon I found a passion for skateboarding. I was able to enjoy this activity by my rules.
                Skateboarding taught me to never give up. We beat ourselves up for hours to achieve goals. Try, adjust, try again...
                (sounds a lot like coding, right?). After a decade of skateboarding I packed up my belongings to move west into
                the mecca of the American skate scene, Southern California. Living solo in California was a reality check
                to say the least. It's an incredibly competitive economy and the cost of living is out of this world 
                compared to North Carolina. I learned to cut costs by any means which involved: minimizing possessions, living in a van,
                living on a boat, and taking any work opportunity. Four years had past and I had found myself a decent
                job managing at a skate shop in historical Carlsbad, CA. Life was better than it had been, but I was
                still working paycheck to paycheck and hardly skateboarding, the passion that had brought me to San Diego.
                It was at this point that I knew I needed to make a major change. 
            </p>
            <h2>Why did I choose Software Development?</h2>
            <p>The technical world isn't going away any time soon. All modern companies can be considered 
                "tech companies", and without developers there is no "tech". These skills are in high 
                demand. My decade-long involvement with the skateboard community led me to believe that software
                development would be a great fit for me. What does skateboarding have to do with coding? Skateboarders
                are relentless. We will give every ounce of energy, fall over and over to accomplish a goal that we
                set for ourselves. It's trial and error, just like development. 
                <br>

                Towards the end of my recent stay in San Diego, I found Momentum. A fully immersive, three month program 
                led by industry professionals; and it was ten minutes away from where I grew up! I plan to acquire the 
                skills to understand both front and back end development in preparation for jobs in this industy. Excitement would 
                be an understatement for how I feel about learning, building, and growing within the Durham technical community.
